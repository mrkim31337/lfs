This is a list of all modifications I remember making to what's written in the book:

* I didn't chown /tools to root:root
* /sbin, /usr/sbin and /bin are a symlink to /usr/bin
* /lib64 and /lib are a symlink to /usr/lib
* linux-headers-3.18.4 instead of 3.16.2
* man-pages: remove getspnam.3 and passwd.5
* zlib: didn't move libz.so.* to /lib because /lib symlinks to /usr/lib
* gcc: move /usr/lib*/*.gdb.py instead of /usr/lib/*gdb.py
* bzip2: didn't do the last 3 lines described in the book and modified the 3 before them so that things get installed to /usr/lib and /usr/bin
* ncurses: didn't move libraries from /usr/lib to /lib ( first line after make install )
